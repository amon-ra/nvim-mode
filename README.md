# nvim-mode package

This package attempts to create a plugin so that Atom can be used as the GUI for Neovim.
This will use the remote plugin / UI architecture of Neovim.

I'm still very far away from getting this to work. You'll most likely want to check out the repoes in **Influences** to see if any more work has been done there. You may not see much progress here for awhile because I'll be reading and exploring some of the options available.
